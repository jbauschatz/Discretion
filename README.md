Discretion
==========

Discretion is an automated proof solver for discrete math proofs.

An example of a proof generated by Discretion:

```
Suppose A ⊆ U and B ⊆ U.
Further suppose x ∈ ~(A ∪ B).
  ¬(x ∈ A ∪ B) by the definition of set complement.
  ¬(x ∈ A ∨ x ∈ B) by the definition of union.
  ¬(x ∈ A) ∧ ¬(x ∈ B) by DeMorgan's Law.
  x ∈ ~A ∧ ¬(x ∈ B) by the definition of set complement.
  x ∈ ~A ∧ x ∈ ~B by the definition of set complement.
So x ∈ ~A ∩ ~B, by the definition of intersection.
Therefore ~(A ∪ B) ⊆ ~A ∩ ~B by the definition of subset, QED.
```

## Running the project

To generate solutions to the homework problems, run:

```
gradle run
```

This will generate solution files for each problem set, for each solving strategy.

To run the JUnit tests, run:

```
gradle test
```

### IDE Setup

Gradle can generate projects for Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA. To generate a project, run:

```
gradle eclipse
```

or

```
gradle idea
```

## How it Works

### Structuring a Proof

Certain kinds of proofs demand a certain structure - there are certain things that must be supposed and concluded in order to complete the proof. For example a typical subset proof has this structure:

```
Suppose A ⊆ U.
Further suppose x ∈ X.
  ...some inferences follow
So x ∈ Y.
X ⊆ Y by the definition of subset.
```

Discretion implements this structured approach to proof solving with the ProofStructureProducer interface.
