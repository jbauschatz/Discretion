Discretion
==========

Discretion is an automated proof solver for discrete math proofs.

An example of a proof generated by Discretion:

```
Suppose A ⊆ U and B ⊆ U.
Further suppose x ∈ ~(A ∪ B).
  ¬(x ∈ A ∪ B) by the definition of set complement.
  ¬(x ∈ A ∨ x ∈ B) by the definition of union.
  ¬(x ∈ A) ∧ ¬(x ∈ B) by DeMorgan's Law.
  x ∈ ~A ∧ ¬(x ∈ B) by the definition of set complement.
  x ∈ ~A ∧ x ∈ ~B by the definition of set complement.
So x ∈ ~A ∩ ~B, by the definition of intersection.
Therefore ~(A ∪ B) ⊆ ~A ∩ ~B by the definition of subset, QED.
```

## Running the project

To generate solutions to the homework problems, run:

```
gradle run
```

This will generate solution files for each problem set, for each solving strategy.

To run the JUnit tests, run:

```
gradle test
```

### IDE Setup

Gradle can generate projects for Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA. To generate a project, run:

```
gradle eclipse
```

or

```
gradle idea
```

## How it Works

### Structuring a Proof

Certain kinds of proofs demand a certain structure - there are certain things that must be supposed and concluded in order to complete the proof. For example a typical subset proof has this structure:

```
Suppose A ⊆ U.
Further suppose x ∈ X.
  ...some inferences follow
So x ∈ Y.
X ⊆ Y by the definition of subset.
```

Discretion implements this structured approach to proof solving with the ProofStructureProducer interface. Each subtype of ProofStructureProducer is responsible for providing the structure to a particular kind of proof. For example the structure of a set equality proof, including two sub-proofs, is provided by the SetEqualityStructure:

```
Suppose A ⊆ U.
Further suppose x ∈ A ∪ (A ∩ B).
  ???
So x ∈ A.
A ∪ (A ∩ B) ⊆ A by the definition of subset.
Now suppose a ∈ A.
  ???
So a ∈ A ∪ (A ∩ B).
A ⊆ A ∪ (A ∩ B) by the definition of subset.
Therefore A ∪ (A ∩ B) = A by the definition of set equality, QED.
```

This approach allows Discretion to solve a proof for "partial credit", in that even if the body of the proof cannot be solve a a valid proof structure may be provided. 

### Completing a proof

### Rules of Inference

Within the given structure of a proof, its body basically consists of a series of inferences. These inferences must procede logically from previous inferences, or supposed facts, until the conclusion is reached.

An rule of inference is represented by the InferenceRule interface. Subtypes of this interface represent a specific mathematical rule. These rules are able to produce new statements from the statements that are assumed, and together they form a chain of inferences that is the heart of the proof. For example the definition of Subset is implemented in this manner:

```
Given: x ∈ A, A ⊆ B

Infer: x ∈ B
```

This rule procedes from the given statements to produce a new statement.

## Search Algorithm

Solving a proof involves performing a breadth-first search algorithm. Branching involves applying any applical inference rule over a set of statements until conclusion is reached. There may be many valid inference chains that reach the conclusion, and Discretion prefers the shortest one.
