A proof helper for discrete math

## Pretty Printing
Displays a proof in a logical and nested manner like this:

```
Suppose X ⊆ Y and Y ⊆ Z.
Further suppose x ∈ X.
  x ∈ Y
So x ∈ Z.
Therefore X ⊆ Z.
```


Sub-proofs introduce a level of indentation, and conslusory words like "so" and "therefore" increase readability.
